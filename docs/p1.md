## Alarm Clock

#### DATA STRUCTURES

>A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In [threads/thread.h](../src/threads/thread.h):
```c
struct thread
  {
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /**< Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /**< Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /**< Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /**< Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /**< Priority. */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /**< List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /**< List element. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and device/timer.c. */
    int64_t ticks;                      /**< Sleep until timer ticks */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /**< Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    unsigned magic;                     /**< Detects stack overflow. */
  };
```

Add the member `ticks` to cause the thread to sleep until timer ticks reaches 
this number.

In [threads/thread.h](../src/threads/thread.h):
```c
/** States in a thread's life cycle. */
enum thread_status
  {
    THREAD_RUNNING,     /**< Running thread. */
    THREAD_READY,       /**< Not running but ready to run. */
    THREAD_BLOCKED,     /**< Waiting for an event to trigger. */
    THREAD_DYING,       /**< About to be destroyed. */
    THREAD_SLEEPING     /**< Sleeping (for debug) */
  };
```

Add a special thread state: `THREAD_SLEEPING` to denote a sleepint thread. This may be 
useful for debugging.

In [threads/thread.c](../src/threads/thread.c):
```c
/** List of all sleeping processes. */
static struct list sleep_list;
```

Keep track of sleeping threads(elem member of sleeping threads).

#### ALGORITHMS

>A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

A call to timer sleep will cause the currently running thread to do the following:

<ul>
  <li>Set the member ticks of running thread;</li>
  <li>Force the thread to yield the CPU;</li>
  <li>Put the thread into sleep list;</li>
</ul>

Upon a timer interrupt, we should scan the sleep list, and decrement the ticks of each sleeping thread.
Add a thread back to ready list if ticks become zero.

>A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>the timer interrupt handler?

Here we introduce a sleep list to store the elem member of all sleeping threads.
In this scenario, the kernel doesn't have to loop up the entire thread list for 
sleeping threads upon timer interrupt, hence time is saved.


#### SYNCHRONIZATION

>A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>timer_sleep() simultaneously?

We turn off external interrupts to avoid race condition.


>A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>during a call to timer_sleep()?


Same answer as `A4`.

#### RATIONALE

>A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>another design you considered?

We choose this design because it is easy to understand and implement. It's also 
free from race conditions.


## Priority Scheduling

#### DATA STRUCTURES

>B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In [threads/thread.h](../src/threads/thread.h):
```c
struct thread
  {
    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    tid_t tid;                          /**< Thread identifier. */
    enum thread_status status;          /**< Thread state. */
    char name[16];                      /**< Name (for debugging purposes). */
    uint8_t *stack;                     /**< Saved stack pointer. */
    int priority;                       /**< Priority (maybe borrowed). */
    int pri_actual;                     /**< Actual priority (no borrow) */
    frac_t recent_cpu;                  /**< Value of recent_cup. */
    struct list_elem allelem;           /**< List element for all threads list. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and synch.c. */
    struct list_elem elem;              /**< List element. */
    struct list locks;                  /**< All locks the thread is holding. */

    /* Shared between thread.c and device/timer.c. */
    int64_t ticks;                      /**< Sleep until timer ticks */

#ifdef USERPROG
    /* Owned by userprog/process.c. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;                  /**< Page directory. */
#endif

    /* Owned by thread.c. */
    unsigned magic;                     /**< Detects stack overflow. */
  };
```

`pri_actual`: we decide to use `priority` to store the borrowed priority of a thread;
and `pri_actual` to store the actual priority of the thread.

`locks` keeps track of all locks the thread is holding; this makes multiple priority 
donation possible.

In [threads/synch.h](../src/threads/synch.h):
```c
struct lock 
  {
    struct thread *holder;      /**< Thread holding lock (for debugging). */
    struct semaphore semaphore; /**< Binary semaphore controlling access. */
    struct list_elem elem;      /** Shared between lock and thread. */
  };
```

`elem` is used to add a lock to a thread's lock list.


>B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>.png file.)

We did not implement nested donation for now.


#### ALGORITHMS

>B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

When `sema_up` or `lock_release` is called, we scan the waiter list for 
the thread of highest priority.


>B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

In a call to `lock_acquire`, we update the priority of thread holding the lock,
and when the thread acquires the lock, we add the lock to the thread's lock list 
and update priority. **No. We did not implement nested donation.**


>B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

In a call to `lock_release`, we remove the lock from the thread's lock list,
and recall donation from the lock (if exists).


#### SYNCHRONIZATION

>B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>this race?

Race condition happens only when timer interrupt arrives in a function call
to lock acquire or release. We avoid it by turning interrupts off.


#### RATIONALE

>B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>another design you considered?

This design is simple and easy to understand. Other designs we've considered
have a lot of edge cases hence are error-prone.


## Advanced Scheduler

#### DATA STRUCTURES

>C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In [threads/frac.h](../src/threads/frac.h):
```c
typedef struct frac 
  {
    int dat;   /**< place to hold the fractional number */
  } 
frac_t;

/** zero in fractional repr */
static const frac_t FRAC_ZERO = {0};
/** max frac number, equivalent to 131071.99 */
static const frac_t FRAC_MAX  = {2147483647};
/** min frac number, equivalent to -131072 */
static const frac_t FRAC_MIN  = {1 << 31};
```

Here we introduce the fractional number type in the `17-14` representation. We also provide 
3 contants: `FRAC_ZERO`, `FRAC_MAX` and `FRAC_MIN`.

In [threads/frac.h](../src/threads/frac.h):
```c
/** Exact value of load_avg */
static frac_t thread_load_avg;
/** Keep track of number of threads in the ready list. This may yield 
  faster load average update. */
static unsigned int thread_ready_count;
```

The purpose is described in the comments.

#### ALGORITHMS

>C2: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

Like in the alarm-clock implementation, we introduce a sleep list to record the sleeping list,
so as to speed up waking up threads in handling a timer interrupt. For the `load_avg` of our 
system requires knowledge of number of ready threads, we manage such a static variable to
accelerate updating `load_avg`.

I also considerd the following representation of a real number $\frac{a}{b}$:
```c
typedef struct frac 
  {
    int a;
    int b;
  } frac_t;
```
But the arithmetic of such type is complicated and error-prone.
